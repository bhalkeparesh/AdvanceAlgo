## Why?
Bucket sort is mainly useful when input(n) is uniformly distributed over a range(k). For example, consider the following problem. 
Sort a large set of floating point numbers which are in range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are uniformly distributed across the range.

## RUN:
1. bucketSort.py  : `python3 bucketSort.py`
Note: This program take command line Input.


## Time Complexity:
- language : `python3`
1. Best case: **O(n+k)**
2. Average case: **O(n+k)**
3. Worse case: **O(n^2)**

## Space Complexity:
- O(n)
